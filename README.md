# Remove-noise-from-images

this question focuses on developing a system to remove noise from digit images. The steps involve loading the MNIST dataset, adding random noise to create a training dataset, setting the target as denoising the images, training a model using a chosen classification method, and plotting the results by comparing the noisy digit images with their denoised counterparts.
